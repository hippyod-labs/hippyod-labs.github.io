TIP: All text with a dollar sign or hash prompt and gray background is meant to be typed by the user in a BASH compatible *nix shell.  Just click through and launch the terminal.  Windows users running can use the Window Subsystem for Linux, run a full update at the Bash terminal and install Podman if it isn't already installed.
