== Overview

There are two competing utilities for building and running containers, *_https://podman.io/docs/installation[Podman^]_* and *_https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/[Docker^]_*.  They are available for Windows, Linux, and Macs, and from the end users point of view, they are completely equivalent when it comes to executing commands; i.e. they can be considered aliases of one another.  On *nix-based systems, `alias docker=podman` will work almost all of the time if only Podman is installed when using basic commands for building images or running containers.

NOTE: Because we feel that <<Fundamental differences between Docker and Podman, Podman is the better tool technologically>>, all commands will only reference `podman`; however, because Docker and Podman are functionally and semantically equivalent when it comes to the basic commands for building and running images and containers, **wherever `podman` is mentioned in this document, `docker` can be safely substituted with no change in meaning or outcome.**

This primer assumes the reader is familiar with the basic concepts behind OCI images and containers.  If not, we suggest reading link:{% post_url 2024-03-27-primer-images-and-containers-part-i-overview %}[Part I^] of this series to cover those topics before continuing.

=== Common Subcommands

The following are a sampling of the most commonly used https://docs.podman.io/en/latest/Commands.html[Podman subcommands^].  Many are shorthand for `podman [image|container] <command>`, depending on whether you are referring to an image or container.  Each subcommand below links to the official documentation for more details.

* https://docs.podman.io/en/v3.0/markdown/podman-build.1.html[build^] - build an image.

  # build an image tagged as some-tag for image repository some-image-repo
  # using a file named Dockerfile in the current directory
  podman build -t some-image-repo:some-tag .

  # build an image tagged as some-tag for image repository some-image-repo
  # using a file named my-dockerfile.base-image in the current directory
  podman build --tag some-image-repo:some-tag --file my-dockerfile.base-image

* help - Help about any subcommand.

  # print a list of Podman's subcommands and options available with every subcommand
  podman help

  # get help with the container ls subcommands
  podman help container ls

* https://docs.podman.io/en/v3.0/markdown/podman-history.1.html[history^] - Print the history of an image, which includes information on each layer in the image, its size, and how it was created.

  # print the history of the python:alpine image
  podman history python:alpine

* https://docs.podman.io/en/v3.0/markdown/podman-images.1.html[images^] - List all images stored locally.  Shorthand for `podman image list`.

  podman images

* https://docs.podman.io/en/v3.0/markdown/podman-inspect.1.html[inspect^] - Print the manifest of an image.

  # print the manifest of the python:alpine image
  python inspect python:alpine

* https://docs.podman.io/en/v3.0/markdown/podman-ps.1.html[ps^] - Lists all running containers.  Shorthand for `podman container list`.

+
NOTE: For those unfamiliar with Shell, the `ps` command lists running processes.

* https://docs.podman.io/en/v3.0/markdown/podman-pull.1.html[pull^] - Pull an image from an image registry.

  # pull the busybox image
  podman pull busybox
+
[NOTE]
====
Docker Hub uses aliases for many of the common, official images it hosts; e.g.

* https://busybox.net/about.html[_busybox_^] - the "Swiss Army knife of Embedded Linux"
* https://www.alpinelinux.org/about/[_alpine_^] - minimalist image based on musl libc and busybox.
====

* https://docs.podman.io/en/v3.0/markdown/podman-push.1.html[push^] - Push an image to an image registry.

  # Push the image myimage:dev to Docker Hub under the account "username"
  podman push myimage:dev docker.io/username/myimage:dev

  podman ps

* https://docs.podman.io/en/v3.0/markdown/podman-rm.1.html[rm^] - Delete a container.

  # delete my_container if it's already stopped
  podman rm my_container

  # force delete my_container
  podman rm -f my_container

  # delete all containers
  podman rm --all

* https://docs.podman.io/en/v3.0/markdown/podman-rmi.1.html[rmi^] - Delete a local image.  Only works if no containers based on the image exist.  Short for `podman image rm`.

  # delete the python:apline image
  podman rmi python:apline

  # delete all locally stored images
  podman rmi --all

[#podman-run]
* https://docs.podman.io/en/v3.0/markdown/podman-run.1.html[run] - Run a container.  Run is shorthand for `podman https://docs.podman.io/en/v3.0/markdown/podman-create.1.html[create^]` and `podman https://docs.podman.io/en/v3.0/markdown/podman-start.1.html[start^]`.

  # Launches a container based on the busybox image with an interactive
  # shell terminal
  podman run -i -t busybox /bin/sh

* https://docs.podman.io/en/v3.0/markdown/podman-tag.1.html[tag] - Optionally rename and/or tag an image.  If no tag follows the ":", defaults to "latest".

  # Completely rename the image
  podman mylocalimage:some-tag myorg/some-other-name:some-other-tag

  # Renames the latest some-image-name to some-other-image-name:latest
  podman some-image-name some-other-image-name

  # Tag an image by its id to some-other-image-name:v1.0
  podman 05455a08881e some-other-image-name:v1.0
  podman inspect alpine

=== Fundamental differences between Docker and Podman

**Docker is a daemon** in *nix based systems, and a service in Windows.  This means it runs in the background all the time, and it runs with root or administrator privileges.

**Podman is binary utility.**  This means it runs only on demand, and can be run with an unprivileged user.

Besides being more efficient with system resources (why run all the time if you donâ€™t have to?), this makes Podman more secure.  Running anything with root/admin privileges is by definition less secure.

==== Podman Related utilities

While Docker is a singular tool, Podman exists within a suite of utilities that are maintained by the *https://github.com/containers[Containers^]* community on GitHub.  Two of these utilities that are worth mentioning here are *_https://github.com/containers/skopeo/blob/main/install.md[Skopeo^]_* and *_https://github.com/containers/buildah[Buildah^]_*.

{back_to_toc}

===== Buildah

For the most part, builds can be executed through Docker and Podman, but Buildah exists in case more complicated builds of images are required than what Podman/Docker can provide through Dockerfiles.  Buildah can also build Dockerfiles.  Complex image builds without a Dockerfile are outside the scope of this primer, and application developers should never need this functionality, but we mention it here for completeness.

{back_to_toc}

===== Skopeo

Skopeo exists to help manage images in remote registries; e.g. copy from one remote registry to another, remote image tagging, or deleting from a remote registry.  Podman only recently added the capability of copying and tagging remote images via `podman scp`, but only skopeo can delete a remote image.  Copying, tagging, and deleting remote images are more DevOps than application developer and therefore our of scope for this primer, but we mention it here for completeness.

== Installing Podman or Docker

The following lab was created and tested locally in a Bash terminal with or https://podman.io/getting-started/installation[Podman^] (or https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/[Docker^], if you'd prefer) and https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git[Git^] already installed.  If needed, follow the links in this paragraph for installation instructions of any of the mentioned utilities.

Windows users can use the https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install[Windows Subsystem for Linux], available to install on all Windows 10+ versions for free.

As a reminder, if you install Docker, `podman` and `docker` commands are completely interchangeable, especially for the purposes of this lab.

== Practical Lab (~10 mins)

include::_posts/snippets/terminal-tip.adoc[]

This lab is a short and simple demonstration to get familiar with some of the basic podman commands above as you manage images and containers locally.  Open a new terminal:

. List your current set of images.

  $ podman images

+
Output:

  REPOSITORY  TAG         IMAGE ID    CREATED     SIZE

+
It should be empty like above if your using Podman for the first time.

. Pull the alpine image.

  $ podman pull alpine

+
Output:

  Resolved "alpine" as an alias (/etc/containers/registries.conf.d/000-shortnames.conf)
  Trying to pull docker.io/library/alpine:latest...
  Getting image source signatures
  Copying blob 4abcf2066143 done   |
  Copying config 05455a0888 done   |
  Writing manifest to image destination
  05455a08881ea9cf0e752bc48e61bbd71a34c029bb13df01e40e3e70e0d007bd

+
Notice that output resolves "alpine" as an alias.

. List your images again to show alpine is now locally stored.

  $ podman images

+
Output:

  REPOSITORY                TAG         IMAGE ID      CREATED       SIZE
  docker.io/library/alpine  latest      05455a08881e  2 months ago  7.67 MB

+
Note the tag is the default, "latest", since we didn't specify which busybox we were pulling.

. Pull the Python image based on the alpine image.

  $ podman pull python:alpine

+
Output:

  Resolved "python" as an alias (/etc/containers/registries.conf.d/000-shortnames.conf)
  Trying to pull docker.io/library/python:alpine...
  Getting image source signatures
  Copying blob b62713ed4827 done   |
  Copying blob 3a6cecfe7003 done   |
  Copying blob c3cdf40b8bda done   |
  Copying blob 4abcf2066143 skipped: already exists
  Copying blob 60d2faee92e7 done   |
  Copying config f44387b482 done   |
  Writing manifest to image destination
  f44387b482817f41bdac1892c45711adaedb3a7dd381844cdc3f360e66314d7a

+
Note that python also resolves to an alias on Docker Hub.  Also notice one of the layers was skipped, which represents the alpine layer that was pulled right before it.  Podman caches layers so it only has to pull them once.

. List your images again to show both images are now locally stored.

  $ podman images

+
Output:

  REPOSITORY                TAG         IMAGE ID      CREATED       SIZE
  docker.io/library/python  alpine      f44387b48281  3 days ago    60.2 MB
  docker.io/library/alpine  latest      05455a08881e  2 months ago  7.67 MB

. Inspect the local alpine image.

  $ podman inspect alpine

+
Output:

+
If you read through the information above, you can get information on the image digest, tags, and the "Config" section explains that the `Cmd` that the command that is run when the container is launched is `sh`, for example.

. List your running containers.

  $ podman ps

+
Output:

  CONTAINER ID  IMAGE       COMMAND     CREATED     STATUS      PORTS       NAMES

+
Again, it should be empty like the initial list of images above if your using Podman for the first time, or simply have no running containers.

. Launch a alpine container with an interactive shell and use it.

  $ podman run --interactive --tty --name my_first_container alpine

+
Output:

  / #

+
You should now be in an interactive shell running _inside_ the alpine container.  This bypasses original command that would have been run so we can interact with the image directly.  You'll can use this command to inspect a running container for QA purposes.

. List everything in the current directory.

  / # ls -al

+

Since alpine is a simple Linux container, as expected the output is the contents of the root directory of a typical Linux system.

. Create a file in the container filesystem, and list everything in the directory again.

This demonstrates how each container runs as if in it's own, individual host, and has it's own, separate filesystem.  The greetings.txt file is now mounted in the root filesystem.
  
. Print the output of the file in the container.

  / # cat /app/greeting.txt
  
+
Output:

  Howdy
  
. **In a separate, local terminal**, add some text to the file.

  $ echo -n ", y'all" >> greetings.txt
  
. In the container terminal, print the contents.

  / # cat /app/greeting.txt
  
+
Output:

  Howdy, y'all
  
+
This shows that changes to mounted files are reflected immediately in the container.

+
TIP: Mounting files into a container is how applications can keep their configurations external to the container.  "Build once, deploy many" means many different configurations for many different needs and environments.

. **In a separate, local terminal**, list the running container.

  $ podman ps

+
Output:

  CONTAINER ID  IMAGE                            COMMAND     CREATED        STATUS        PORTS       NAMES
  61b3a1045161  docker.io/library/alpine:latest  /bin/sh     5 minutes ago  Up 5 minutes              my_first_container
  92a7acea77c5  docker.io/library/alpine:latest  /bin/sh     2 minutes ago  Up 2 minutes              my_second_container

+
This demonstrates that both containers are running on your local system, and each running from a shell launched from `sh`.

. Kill both running containers.

+
TIP: Podman has tab completion enabled for subcommands and for images and containers, so you don't have to type the complete
container name.

  $ podman kill my_first_container my_second_container

+
Output:

  my_first_container
  my_second_container

+
TIP: If look in your previous two terminals, you should now see both have returned to your local command prompt since both containers
aren't running anymore.

. List the containers again to show they are not running anymore.

  $ podman ps

+
Output:

  CONTAINER ID  IMAGE                             COMMAND     CREATED        STATUS        PORTS       NAMES

. List containers that aren't running to show they're still on the system.

  $ podman ps -a

+
Output:

  CONTAINER ID  IMAGE                            COMMAND     CREATED         STATUS                       PORTS       NAMES
  33808400cc0c  docker.io/library/alpine:latest  /bin/sh     14 minutes ago  Exited (137) About a minute ago          my_first_container
  db00ffdbd9ff  docker.io/library/alpine:latest  /bin/sh     7  minutes ago  Exited (137) About a minute ago          my_second_container

. Cleanup the system by removing the unused containers and the images.

  $ podman rm my_first_container my_second_container my_third_container
  $ podman rmi python:alpine alpine

+
TIP: We could typed `podman rmi -a && podman rm -a`, but this isn't always the best idea when you might be using many images on your machine during development and simply forgot, so we avoid the habit.

+
Output:

  my_first_container
  my_second_container

The above output confirms all containers and images that were created and pulled, respectively, have been removed from your local system.

This concludes the lab.
