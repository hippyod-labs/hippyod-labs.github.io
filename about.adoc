This site is both my personal blog focusing on my technological musings and a source repository for labs that support the articles I write.  All information and opinions on this site are solely my own.

== Development Background

I have been a software developer since 1993.  The vast majority of my career has been spent working in Java in both the front and middle tiers, although I been currenlty working as a DevOps services Principal Consultant for Red Hat since 2019 specializing in advising on and automating application deployments and migrations to OpenShift.

While not a complete list for my career, I have experience in the following languages and technologies:

* OpenShift/Kubernetes
* Helm
* Kustomize
* Java
* Spring
* Python
* JSON/YAML
* Bash/Shell
* Jenkins
* Groovy

== Career Overview

My experience spans multiple industries from banking and insurance to biotech to software development.  I have worked in almost every position in software engineering from the Director level on down, and worked in companies whose size ranges from startups I've founded to giant Fortune 500 firms.

My main focus for that past few years besides being a hands on software developer and architect has been on being the best consultant I can be.  I am a firm believer that the first three steps in any software project are:

* Understand the stakeholder's problem domain.
* Identify one or more solutions.
* Convince whoever is paying that those solutions will meet the stakeholders needs in a cost effective manner.

== OSS Projects

  My main, current project is a turnkey, configurable, enterprise CICD solution for Kubernetes licensed under the LGPL 2.1.  The project is built on top of https://www.jenkins.io/[image:https://www.jenkins.io/images/logos/jenkins/256.png[width=18 height=18] Jenkins].

* https://github.com/elcicd/el-CICD-deploy[el-CICD Charts] +
  A large subproject of el-CICD in and of itself. They are a collection of https://helm.sh/[image:https://helm.sh/img/helm.svg[width=18 height=18] Helm] Charts that support dynamic values files, arbitrary deployment profiles, and a complete set of Kubernetes resources to support application deployments.

== This site
:asciidocimage: https://docs.asciidoctor.org/_/img/asciidoctor-logo.svg
This site was built, rendered, and hosted using the following resources
  
* https://github.com/^[image:https://github.githubassets.com/assets/GitHub-Mark-ea2971cee799.png[width=18 hieght=18]  Github^] +
  GitHub hosts this site and the labs.  GitHub as a product is a developer platform that allows developers to create, store, manage and share their code.  As a company they are a subsidiary of Microsoft. 
  
* https://jekyllrb.com/[image:https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3083652?s=48&v=4[width=18 hieght=18]  Jekyll^] +
  Jekyll is a static site generator written in Ruby.  This bloge is wholly created from it.

* https://docs.asciidoctor.org/[image:{asciidocimage}[width=18 hieght=18]  Asciidoc^] +
  AsciiDoc is a human-readable document format, semantically equivalent to DocBook XML, but using plain-text mark-up conventions.  All the articles are written in and formatted with Asciidoc, which is a much stronger and better markup language than standard or GitHub style Markdown.
  
* https://github.com/asciidoctor/jekyll-asciidoc[image:{asciidocimage}[width=18 hieght=18]  jekyll-asciidoc^] +
  The Jekyll AsciiDoc plugin converts AsciiDoc to embeddable HTML.  This plugin is necessary to properly generate the static pages from Jekyll.
