== Site technology stack
:asciidocimage: https://docs.asciidoctor.org/_/img/asciidoctor-logo.svg
This site was built, rendered, and hosted using the following resources:
  
* https://github.com/[image:https://github.githubassets.com/assets/GitHub-Mark-ea2971cee799.png[width=18 height=18]  Github^] +
  GitHub https://github.com/hippyod-labs[hosts this site and the source for the labs^].  GitHub as a product is a developer and OSS-friendly platform that allows us to create, store, manage and share our code, and a Microsoft subsidiary as a company.
  
* https://jekyllrb.com/[image:https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3083652?s=48&v=4[width=18 height=18]  Jekyll^] +
  Jekyll is a static site generator written in Ruby.  This blog is wholly created from it.

* https://docs.asciidoctor.org/[image:{asciidocimage}[width=18 height=18]  Asciidoc^] +
  AsciiDoc is a human-readable document format, semantically equivalent to DocBook XML, but using plain-text mark-up conventions.  All the primers are written in and formatted with Asciidoc, which is a much stronger and better markup language than standard or GitHub style https://www.markdownguide.org/[Markdown].
  
* https://github.com/asciidoctor/jekyll-asciidoc[image:{asciidocimage}[width=18 height=18]  jekyll-asciidoc^] +
  Jekyll supports Markdown as a document format by default.  The jekyll-asciiDoc plugin enables Jekyll to use AsciiDoc document.
